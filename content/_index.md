Behind the satire and sci-fi dystopia, GenBattle is an experiment.

We’re building a new kind of media competition — one that’s actually fun to watch, fun to join, and a serious benchmark for the cutting edge of generative media AI.

At its core, GenBattle is about showcasing the skills of top-tier prompt engineers using the most advanced AI media generation models available today. But instead of dry benchmarks or corporate presentations, we wrap it all in a layer of absurd future fiction — because why not?
