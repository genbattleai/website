## GenBattle & You

GenBattle is a video battleground for AI video generation models. We want to have fun, so each challenge has a sarcastic and/or satirical theme but the core mission will always remain the same:

>Benchmark the latest and greatest AI video generation models in the hands of some of the most talented prompt engineers in the world.

What sets GenBattle apart from other AI video leaderboards (like [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/)) is that we seek to put a spotlight on the prompt engineering skills of the participants.
